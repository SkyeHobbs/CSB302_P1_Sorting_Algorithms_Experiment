## Project Overview

In this project, you will use Java to run experiments in testing the efficiencies of the Sorting Algorithms:

Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Shell Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort (pivot selected as first element)
Quick Sort (pivot selected as random element)
Quick Sort (pivot selected with Median-of-three)
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
Bucket Sort
Radix Sort

In addition to the coding, a Word or Markdown document final report will be created that will detail the design and experimental results.
