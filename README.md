## Project Overview
This project conducts an experimental analysis of 12 sorting algorithms, including Insertion 
Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (First Pivot, Random Pivot, Median-of-Three Pivot), Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, and Radix Sort. It evaluates their performance by sorting 70 test arrays per algorithm, with sizes ranging from 4 to 32,768 and various input configurations (random, sorted, reverse-sorted, 50% sorted, and 75% sorted). Each algorithmâ€™s execution time is measured in microseconds, and the results are stored in CSV files for further analysis.

## Features
1. **Generate Arrays**: Creates 14 different array sizes (powers of 2 from 4 to 32,768) with random integers (0-40,000) in five variations: random, ordered, reverse-ordered, 50% ordered, and 75% ordered.
2. **Sort and Measure Performance**: Implements 12 sorting algorithms, measuring execution time in microseconds for 70 arrays per algorithm.
3. **Export Data and Visualize Results**: Stores runtime data in CSV files and generates performance charts for comparison.
